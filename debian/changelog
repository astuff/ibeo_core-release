  * Merge pull request #6 <https://github.com/astuff/ibeo_core/issues/6> from astuff/fix/bad_alloc
    Fix bad_alloc SEGSIV error.
  * Merge pull request #4 <https://github.com/astuff/ibeo_core/issues/4> from ShepelIlya/patch-1
    Fix for reading of object_box_orientation_angle
    Byte order for object bounding box orientation angle changed from little-endian to big-endian. According to the document "Interface Specification for ibeo LUX, ibeo LUX systems and ibeo Evaluation Suite", version 1.48 from 30.05.2017 there is big-endian byte order for all fields in Object2280. If i am using original code orientation of objects orientation changes abruptly. With that fix it seems to work correct.
